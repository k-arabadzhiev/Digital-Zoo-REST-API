This codebase serves as a backend api for Digital Zoo. It is built with **Kotlin + Ktor + Exposed + MariaDB** including 
CRUD operations, authentication and routing. 

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies used
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - programming language
- [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) - asynchronous WEB Framework
- [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) - SQL Framework
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) - Database
- [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) - serialization/deserialization of JSON
- Repository pattern

# üèÉ Getting started
1. Clone or download the repo, then open the directory as IntelliJ IDEA (2021+) project.
2. Start MariaDB server at port `3306` and create database `zoo`. These are the values in `hikari.properties`. I'm 
   using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) for this step, but you're allowed to use whatever you like.
3. Use the `zoo.sql` script to populate the database.
4. Run the application (Ctrl+Shift+F10)

# üïπÔ∏è Usage
The app defines the following endpoints at `localhost:8080/`: 
- `GET animals/all` - responds with JSON array that contains all animals in the database.
- `GET animals/photo/{photoPath...}` - responds with a photo from the given photoPath.
- `POST zookeeper/new` - send firstname, lastname, username and password as urlencoded parameters.
- `POST zookeeper/login` - send username and password as urlencoded. Response is JWT.
- `POST animal/new` - Multipart data - JSON object with animal info and photo. Also requires authorization. 
- `POST animal/update` - same as above, but photo is optional.
  
There are examples in `post.http`, however they require IntelliJ Ultimate edition. Community Edition users might 
want to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
When uploading photo, the default save location is `E:\Animals\` and it will not be written in the database, 
instead the corresponding GET query for the photo will be. 

Example: 

File location: 
> E:\Animals\Animals\Vertebrates\Birds\Owl.jpeg

Database entry / GET query:
> photo/Animals/Vertebrates/Birds/Owl.jpeg
